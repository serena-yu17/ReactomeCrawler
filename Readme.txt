This program utilizes gene pathway data from reactome.org and geneBank data from NCBI, and works out the gene interaction network in MySQL.

The data file downloaded fron NCBI (HS.txt) was somehow missing many genes, and I had to crawl them online from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/. Alternatively, I can crawl everying online and ignore HS.txt. The html was then analysed and gene ID extracted.
